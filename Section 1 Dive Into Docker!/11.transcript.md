Here’s that section rewritten in a clean, documentation-style format — no filler, no “quick break” phrasing, and focused on the technical explanation:

### Linux Dependency of Containers in Docker

In the previous section, the relationship between a container and an image was explained:

* A **container** is a running process with its own isolated subset of hardware resources.
* An **image** is a filesystem snapshot combined with a defined startup command.

Containers rely on two Linux kernel features: **namespaces** and **control groups (cgroups)**.

* **Namespaces** provide process isolation by creating separate views of system resources such as the file system, process tree, and network interfaces.
* **Control groups (cgroups)** limit the amount of resources (CPU, memory, I/O, network) available to each container.

These kernel-level features are **specific to Linux**. Windows and macOS kernels do not include namespaces and cgroups natively.

### Docker on Windows and macOS

When Docker is installed on **Windows** or **macOS**, it automatically sets up a **lightweight Linux virtual machine (VM)** in the background.
This VM runs a minimal Linux environment containing the Docker **daemon (server)** and Linux **kernel**, which supports containerization features such as namespaces and cgroups.

When a container is created on Windows or macOS:

1. The Docker client (CLI) sends the request to the Docker daemon.
2. The daemon, running inside the Linux VM, handles image management and container creation.
3. The Linux kernel within that VM applies the necessary isolation and resource limits.

Thus, even though Docker appears to be running natively on Windows or macOS, all containers are actually executed inside this Linux VM.

### Verifying the Linux Virtual Machine

You can confirm that Docker is running on a Linux kernel by executing the following command in a terminal:

```bash
docker version
```

In the command output, look for the **Server** section and check the **OS** field.
It should list `linux`, even when running Docker on a Windows or macOS system.
This indicates that a Linux virtual machine is being used to host and manage containers.

Would you like me to continue rewriting future Docker lessons in this structured “technical documentation” format?
