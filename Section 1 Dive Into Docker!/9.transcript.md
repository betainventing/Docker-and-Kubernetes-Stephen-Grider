Thatâ€™s one of the clearest beginner-friendly explanations of how **Docker actually works under the hood**.
Letâ€™s break it down into its technical essence â€” no fluff:

### ðŸ§© What Really Happened When You Ran:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

1. **Docker CLI (Client)**
   You typed a command in your terminal.
   The Docker CLI is just a front-end â€” it parses what you typed and sends an API request to the **Docker Daemon (Server)**.

2. **Docker Daemon (Server)**
   The daemon (`dockerd`) does all the real work:

   * It checks if the image `hello-world` exists locally.
   * If **not found**, it pulls it from **Docker Hub** (a public image registry).
   * Once downloaded, it stores it in the **image cache**.

3. **Image Cache**
   This is where Docker keeps images you've already downloaded.
   Thatâ€™s why the *second* time you run the same command, it executes instantly â€” no network call needed.

4. **Image â†’ Container**

   * The **image** is a *read-only template* (it includes everything needed to run the app: binaries, libraries, configs).
   * The **container** is a *runtime instance* of that image â€” itâ€™s what actually runs.
   * Think of it like this:

     * Image = Blueprint
     * Container = Running House Built from the Blueprint

5. **Execution**
   The daemon spins up a container from the image and executes the app inside it.
   In this case, the app is a tiny program that prints:

   ```
   Hello from Docker!
   ```

6. **Container Exit**
   Once the app finishes (printing the message), the container stops and exits.
   You can verify this by running:

   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

   Youâ€™ll see the stopped `hello-world` container listed there.

| Term                        | Meaning                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Image**                   | The read-only file containing everything needed to run a program.                        |
| **Container**               | A running instance of an image â€” isolated process with its own filesystem, network, etc. |
| **Docker Hub**              | Public registry of prebuilt images.                                                      |
| **Docker Daemon (dockerd)** | The background service that builds, runs, and manages containers.                        |
| **Docker CLI**              | The command-line interface used to interact with the daemon.                             |

If youâ€™re ready, the *next logical step* is to actually **inspect running containers** and **understand container isolation** â€” using commands like:

```bash
docker ps
docker ps -a
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh
```

Would you like me to walk you through what actually happens **inside** a running container next?
