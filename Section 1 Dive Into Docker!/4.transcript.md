Perfect. Here’s a clean, course-ready Markdown version of your Docker notes:

# Docker Basics

## What Is Docker?

Docker is not just a single tool — it’s an **ecosystem** of components that work together to create and run *containers*.  

When someone says they “use Docker,” they might be referring to one or more of these components:

- **Docker Client (CLI)** – Command-line tool to interact with Docker.  
- **Docker Server (Daemon)** – Background service that builds, runs, and manages containers.  
- **Docker Hub** – Cloud-based registry storing and distributing container images.  
- **Docker Compose** – Tool for defining and running multi-container applications.

All of these together form the **Docker platform**, enabling developers to build, share, and run containerized applications.

## Images and Containers

When you run a command like:

```bash
docker run redis
````

Docker performs the following steps:

1. The **Docker CLI** contacts **Docker Hub**.
2. It downloads a **Docker image** – a single file containing everything needed to run a specific program, including dependencies and configuration.
3. Docker uses that image to create a **container** – an isolated, running instance of the image.

---

## Key Terminology

* **Image:**
  A read-only file defining what’s inside a container, including the application code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration.

* **Container:**
  A running instance of an image. It is a lightweight, isolated environment with its own:

  * CPU and memory space
  * Network stack
  * Filesystem

Containers share the host OS kernel, making them faster and more efficient than traditional virtual machines.

---

## Summary

* Docker = platform for building, sharing, and running containers.
* **Images** are the building blocks.
* **Containers** are isolated, running instances of images.
* Containers provide a lightweight, portable way to run applications consistently across environments.

If you want, I can also **add diagrams in Markdown** (ASCII or embedded images) to make it visually easier to understand for a course handout. This helps especially with “image → container → container runtime” flow. Do you want me to do that?
