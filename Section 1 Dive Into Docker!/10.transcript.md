### Understanding Containers and Their Relationship to the Operating System

To understand containers, it’s important to first understand how an operating system manages resources.

Every operating system has a **kernel**, which is responsible for managing access between applications (processes) and physical hardware (such as the CPU, memory, disk, and network interfaces).

Applications like Chrome, a terminal, or Node.js don’t communicate directly with hardware. Instead, they make **system calls** to the kernel, which then performs the requested actions—such as reading or writing data to disk, allocating memory, or using network interfaces.

### Namespacing

A key concept in containerization is **namespacing**.
Namespacing allows the kernel to isolate and segment hardware and software resources for specific processes or groups of processes.

For example:

* Each process can have its own isolated view of the file system.
* Processes can be restricted to see only specific network interfaces.
* Processes can be prevented from seeing or communicating with other processes.

In practice, namespacing ensures that each containerized process perceives it has its own independent environment, even though it shares the same kernel with other containers.

---

### Control Groups (cgroups)

**Control groups**, or **cgroups**, complement namespacing by limiting the *amount* of resources a process can use.

Cgroups can restrict:

* CPU usage
* Memory allocation
* Disk I/O
* Network bandwidth

Together, namespacing and cgroups provide both **isolation** and **resource control**.
This combination is what forms the technical foundation of a **container**.

### What a Container Actually Is

A **container** is not a physical construct. It is a running process (or group of processes) with isolated access to specific system resources.
The kernel ensures that each container’s system calls are directed only to its assigned segment of resources—its own view of file system, memory, CPU, and network.

### Relationship Between an Image and a Container

A **Docker image** is a **filesystem snapshot** combined with a **startup command**.

When a container is created from an image:

1. The kernel allocates an isolated section of system resources (file system, memory, CPU, etc.).
2. The image’s filesystem snapshot is copied into this isolated environment.
3. The startup command defined in the image is executed, launching the main process of the container.

Once that process starts, it runs independently within its allocated resources, forming the container.

---

This process—isolating system resources through namespacing and cgroups, then running a process based on an image’s configuration—is the foundation of Docker and other container technologies.
