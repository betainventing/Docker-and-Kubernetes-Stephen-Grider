This section introduces the `docker run` command — the foundation of how you start containers.
Here’s the technical breakdown of what the instructor is describing:

### 1. **Command Overview**

```
docker run <image_name>
```

* `docker` → CLI client that communicates with the Docker daemon.
* `run` → Creates and starts a new container from the specified image.
* `<image_name>` → The base image used to create the container (e.g., `hello-world`, `nginx`, `ubuntu`).

### 2. **What Happens Behind the Scenes**

When you execute:

```
docker run hello-world
```

Docker performs these steps:

1. **Checks if the image exists locally.**

   * If not, it downloads it from Docker Hub (the default registry).
2. **Creates a new container.**

   * Think of this as a lightweight, isolated runtime environment with its own filesystem (a snapshot of the image).
3. **Starts a process inside the container.**

   * For `hello-world`, the command just runs a small program that prints a message.
4. **Container exits once the process finishes.**

   * Since `hello-world` completes instantly, the container stops and is no longer running.

### 3. **Key Concept**

* A **Docker image** = a *blueprint* (read-only filesystem snapshot).
* A **Docker container** = a *runtime instance* of that image (read/write layer + process + resources).

### 4. **Next Steps (Preview)**

In the upcoming sections, you’ll explore:

* Flags and options for `docker run` (e.g., `-d`, `-p`, `-v`, `--name`).
* How to keep containers running in the background.
* How to interact with containers using commands like `docker ps`, `docker exec`, and `docker logs`.

Would you like me to explain in detail the internal steps Docker takes (like how namespaces, cgroups, and layers work) when you run a container?
