This section is a **hands-on demo of how to execute commands inside a running Docker container** — specifically using the `docker exec` command — and introduces the purpose of the `-it` flag (which is crucial for interactive work inside containers).

Let’s break it down technically.

---

### **1. The Context**

You already have a Redis container running:

```bash
docker run redis
```

That container is running the `redis-server` process **inside its own isolated environment**.

Now, you want to also run another process — the **Redis CLI (`redis-cli`)** — inside that same container so you can interact with the Redis server directly.

---

### **2. The Command: `docker exec`**

The syntax:

```bash
docker exec [OPTIONS] <container_id_or_name> <command>
```

Purpose:

* `exec` = execute a **new command** inside an **already running container**.

---

### **3. Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

#### **Step 1 — Check if Redis container is running**

```bash
docker ps
```

You’ll see output like:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE   COMMAND        STATUS         PORTS  NAMES
a1b2c3d4e5f6   redis   "redis-server" Up 2 minutes         some-redis
```

---

#### **Step 2 — Execute a second command inside the container**

Use the `docker exec` command:

```bash
docker exec -it a1b2c3d4e5f6 redis-cli
```

Breaking it down:

* `exec` → execute a new process in the container.
* `-i` → keep STDIN (input stream) open — so you can type commands.
* `-t` → allocate a pseudo-TTY — gives you a terminal interface.
* `redis-cli` → the command to execute inside.

---

### **4. What Happens When You Run It**

After running that command, you’ll see:

```
127.0.0.1:6379>
```

You can now run Redis commands:

```bash
set myvalue 5
get myvalue
```

→ Output: `5`

You’re **inside the container**, talking directly to the Redis server process via its internal network.

---

### **5. What Happens If You Omit `-it`**

Try:

```bash
docker exec a1b2c3d4e5f6 redis-cli
```

Result:

* You’re **immediately returned** to your shell.
* No prompt appears.
* Redis CLI exits instantly.

Why?

* Without `-i`, your terminal’s **input stream isn’t attached**, so Redis CLI receives no input.
* Without `-t`, you don’t get an interactive terminal session.
* Redis CLI expects user input — when it detects none, it exits.

---

### **6. Why `-it` Matters**

`-it` = `-i` + `-t`

| Flag | Meaning                        | Why it matters                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `-i` | Interactive (keeps STDIN open) | Lets you send commands                     |
| `-t` | TTY (pseudo-terminal)          | Gives you a readable prompt (like a shell) |

They’re used whenever you want to **interactively work** inside a container — for example:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```

→ Gives you a shell **inside the container**.

Without `-it`, Docker runs the command non-interactively — suitable for scripts or background jobs, not user sessions.

---

### **7. Quick Recap**

| Command                          | Description                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker run redis`               | Starts a container running Redis server                        |
| `docker ps`                      | Lists running containers                                       |
| `docker exec -it <id> redis-cli` | Starts Redis CLI *inside* the running container, interactively |
| `docker exec <id> redis-cli`     | Runs Redis CLI without interactivity → exits immediately       |
| `Ctrl + C`                       | Exits the interactive Redis CLI session                        |

---

### **8. Key Takeaway**

The `docker exec -it` command is how you:

* Enter a container’s environment.
* Run additional processes.
* Interact with the container like a mini Linux system.

It’s foundational — you’ll use it constantly to debug, inspect, and interact with containers (not just Redis, but any service running inside Docker).
