Here’s a clear summary of this section:

### **Containers Do Not Share File Systems by Default**

1. **Isolation Principle:**

   * Each Docker container gets its own **isolated filesystem**.
   * Changes in one container **do not appear** in another container automatically.

2. **Demo Example:**

   * Start two BusyBox containers:

     ```bash
     docker run -it busybox sh  # First container
     docker run -it busybox sh  # Second container
     ```
   * In the first container:

     ```bash
     touch hi_there
     ls  # shows hi_there
     ```
   * In the second container:

     ```bash
     ls  # hi_there is NOT present
     ```
   * This confirms each container has a **completely separate filesystem**.

3. **Key Takeaway:**

   * Containers are isolated by design.
   * **No automatic sharing** of files between containers.
   * To share files, you need to explicitly create **volumes or bind mounts**.

4. **Exiting a Container Shell:**

   * Use `Ctrl+D` or type `exit` to leave the container shell.

**Bottom line:**
Containers are isolated mini environments. What you do inside one container **stays inside that container** unless you explicitly set up sharing mechanisms.

If you want, I can make a **small diagram showing this isolation and the difference with shared volumes**—it makes this concept super intuitive. Do you want me to do that?
