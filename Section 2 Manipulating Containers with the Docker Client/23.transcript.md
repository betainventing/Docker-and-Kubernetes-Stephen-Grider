Here’s a clear breakdown of what’s happening in this section:

---

### **1. The Goal**

You want **full terminal (shell) access inside a running container** so you can:

* Run multiple commands interactively.
* Inspect or debug the container.
* Avoid repeatedly using `docker exec` for every single command.

---

### **2. The Command**

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> sh
```

* `docker exec` → execute a command inside a running container.
* `-it` → interactive terminal:

  * `-i` = keep stdin open (so you can type input)
  * `-t` = allocate a pseudo-terminal (nicely formatted output)
* `<container_id>` → identifies which container to access.
* `sh` → starts a **shell program** inside the container.

---

### **3. What `sh` Is**

* `sh` is a **command processor (shell)**.
* Like Bash, Zsh, or PowerShell, it allows you to type commands and execute them.
* Most containers include `sh` by default; some also include `bash`.
* Using `sh` gives you **full terminal capabilities inside the container**.

---

### **4. Example Actions Inside the Container**

Once inside the container’s shell:

* Navigate directories:

  ```bash
  cd /home
  cd /
  ```
* List files:

  ```bash
  ls
  ```
* Run commands:

  ```bash
  echo "hi there"
  export B=5
  echo $B
  redis-cli
  ```
* Exit the shell:

  * `Ctrl+C` or `Ctrl+D`

---

### **5. Why This Is Useful**

* You get a **real-time, interactive session** inside your container.
* Essential for **debugging** and **inspecting running processes**.
* Lets you run multiple commands without repeatedly using `docker exec`.

---

**Key Takeaway:**

> `docker exec -it <container_id> sh` is your go-to for full terminal access inside a container. It’s probably the single most common way to interactively work with a running Docker container.

If you want, I can make a **diagram showing the container, shell, and your terminal connected through `-it`**, which makes this concept much easier to visualize. Do you want me to do that?
