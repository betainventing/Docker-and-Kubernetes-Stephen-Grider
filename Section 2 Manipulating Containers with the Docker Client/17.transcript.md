This section focuses on **cleaning up stopped containers and unused Docker data** using the `docker system prune` command — a housekeeping step to reclaim disk space.

Here’s the breakdown:

---

### **1. Why Cleanup Matters**

When you stop containers, they **don’t disappear** — they stay on disk.
Each stopped container keeps:

* Metadata (container ID, image reference, logs, etc.)
* Its writable filesystem layer
  Over time, this can **consume a lot of disk space**, especially if you’re frequently building, testing, or running containers.

To see what’s sitting idle:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

You’ll see entries with `STATUS` showing `Exited`.

---

### **2. Removing Stopped Containers**

You could delete containers individually:

```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

…but if you have many, it’s easier to clean everything at once.

---

### **3. The `docker system prune` Command**

Run:

```bash
docker system prune
```

This removes:

* **All stopped containers**
* **All unused networks**
* **All dangling images** (images not tagged or linked to any container)
* **Build cache**

You’ll get a warning like:

```
WARNING! This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all dangling images
  - all build cache
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N]
```

If you type `y` (or `yes`) and hit Enter, Docker deletes all those resources and prints a summary like:

```
Deleted Containers:
a1b2c3d4e5f6
b2c3d4e5f6g7

Total reclaimed space: 105.4MB
```

Afterward:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

→ You’ll see **no stopped containers** listed.

---

### **4. Important Note About Build Cache**

The **build cache** includes:

* Layers from Docker builds
* Pulled images from Docker Hub

After pruning, those images are gone — meaning next time you run a container, Docker will have to **pull them again**.
That’s not a big deal — just expect a short wait the first time you run something like:

```bash
docker run busybox echo hi there
```

---

### **5. Optional: Clean Even More Aggressively**

If you also want to remove **unused volumes** (which `docker system prune` does *not* remove by default):

```bash
docker system prune -a --volumes
```

That’s a **full wipe** — it removes:

* All stopped containers
* All unused images (not just dangling ones)
* All unused networks
* All unused volumes
  Use this with caution.

---

### **6. Practical Advice**

Keep this in mind:

* Use `docker system prune` **periodically** to keep your environment lean.
* Use `docker system prune -a --volumes` **only** when you’re sure you won’t need old containers, images, or data volumes.
* Don’t run prune commands on **production** systems unless you understand what’s being deleted.
