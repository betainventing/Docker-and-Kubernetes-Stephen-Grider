This section finishes explaining the **container lifecycle** — specifically, what happens **after** a container exits and how to interact with it afterward.

Here’s the detailed breakdown:

---

### **1. Checking Exited Containers**

To see all containers (both running and stopped):

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Example output:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND              STATUS                     NAMES
a1b2c3d4e5f6   busybox    "echo hi there"      Exited (0) 15 seconds ago  goofy_sammet
```

If `STATUS` says `Exited`, it means:

* The container’s main process (the default command) finished running.
* The container is **stopped**, but **still exists** on disk.
* It can be **restarted** later.

---

### **2. Starting an Exited Container Again**

You can restart it using its **container ID** or **name**:

```bash
docker start -a <container_id>
```

Example:

```bash
docker start -a a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

Output:

```
hi there
```

This re-runs the **same command** (`echo hi there`) that was used when the container was first created.

---

### **3. Important Behavior**

* When you **start** an existing container:

  * It **re-executes the original command** used at creation.
  * You **cannot override** the command (like you can with `docker run`).
  * The container keeps the **same filesystem, environment variables, and metadata** from when it was first created.

Example (invalid):

```bash
docker start -a a1b2c3d4e5f6 echo bye there
```

This fails because `docker start` doesn’t accept a new command — it will interpret `echo bye there` as additional container IDs.

If you want to run a new command, you must **create a new container**:

```bash
docker run busybox echo bye there
```

---

### **4. Conceptual Summary**

| Stage       | Command                               | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Create**  | `docker create busybox echo hi there` | Prepares the container (filesystem + metadata) |
| **Start**   | `docker start -a <id>`                | Runs the command inside it                     |
| **Exited**  | (after command completes)             | Container stops, but persists                  |
| **Restart** | `docker start -a <id>`                | Re-runs the same original command              |
| **Remove**  | `docker rm <id>`                      | Deletes the container entirely                 |

---

### **5. Why This Matters**

Understanding this lifecycle is critical because:

* You’ll often need to **inspect or restart** stopped containers for debugging.
* You’ll know when to **reuse**, **remove**, or **rebuild** containers.
* Later commands like `docker exec`, `docker logs`, and `docker commit` rely on knowing what “state” your container is in.

Would you like me to continue into the **next logical concept** — explaining what “Exited” really means internally (process termination, exit codes, and how Docker handles stopped containers on disk)?
