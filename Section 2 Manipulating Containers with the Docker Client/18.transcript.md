This section introduces the **`docker logs`** command — a key tool for viewing what happened inside a container after it has run or exited. It builds on your understanding of the `docker create` and `docker start` workflow.

---

### **1. Recap: The Create–Start Process**

Previously, you saw that:

```bash
docker create busybox echo hi there
```

creates a container and returns a **container ID**.

Then:

```bash
docker start <container_id>
```

starts the container, executes the command (`echo hi there`), and exits.

But there’s a catch:
Without `-a` (attach), `docker start` runs the container in the background and **doesn’t show any output** in your terminal.

---

### **2. Problem: Missing Output**

If you forget to add `-a`:

```bash
docker start <container_id>
```

the container still runs and exits, but you see nothing printed.
If the process inside takes minutes to complete, forgetting `-a` means you won’t see its progress or results in real time — frustrating.

---

### **3. Solution: View Output with `docker logs`**

Instead of rerunning the container, you can retrieve its output afterward:

```bash
docker logs <container_id>
```

Example:

```bash
docker create busybox echo hi there
# returns container ID: 9b3c6d8e1234

docker start 9b3c6d8e1234
# runs silently and exits

docker logs 9b3c6d8e1234
# prints:
# hi there
```

This shows exactly what was output to stdout/stderr when the container ran — **without restarting it**.

---

### **4. Important Behavior**

* `docker logs` **does not re-run or restart** the container.
  It simply **reads the stored log output** from Docker’s internal log files for that container.
* Works for **stopped**, **running**, or **exited** containers.
* Containers store their logs in `/var/lib/docker/containers/<container_id>/<container_id>-json.log` by default (JSON formatted).

---

### **5. Commonly Used Options**

* `-f` — **follow** logs in real time (like `tail -f`):

  ```bash
  docker logs -f <container_id>
  ```
* `--tail <n>` — show only the last *n* lines:

  ```bash
  docker logs --tail 20 <container_id>
  ```
* `-t` — include timestamps:

  ```bash
  docker logs -t <container_id>
  ```

Example combining them:

```bash
docker logs -f -t --tail 50 <container_id>
```

---

### **6. When You’ll Use This**

`docker logs` is one of the **most frequently used** commands for:

* Debugging containers that fail or exit immediately
* Inspecting background services without attaching
* Monitoring startup messages for web servers or APIs
* Viewing stdout/stderr output in CI/CD or troubleshooting workflows

---

### **7. Summary**

| Command         | Purpose                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `docker create` | Creates container, doesn’t start it        |
| `docker start`  | Starts container; `-a` attaches output     |
| `docker logs`   | Retrieves container output after execution |

Would you like me to explain how **Docker manages and stores container logs under the hood** (log drivers, JSON files, etc.) next? It ties directly into this topic.
