This section explains the **container lifecycle** and clarifies the relationship between the commands
`docker run`, `docker create`, and `docker start`.

Here’s the breakdown in plain, technical terms:

---

### **1. The Container Lifecycle**

When you use Docker, containers move through several basic stages:

```
Image → Created → Running → Exited (→ optionally Removed)
```

Understanding the difference between “created” and “running” is key.

---

### **2. `docker run` = `docker create` + `docker start`**

The command:

```bash
docker run <image>
```

is a **shortcut** for two separate operations:

```bash
docker create <image>
docker start <container_id>
```

**What each step does:**

* **`docker create`**

  * Prepares the container’s *filesystem* from the image.
  * Assigns it a unique container ID.
  * Does **not** start executing anything yet.
  * Example:

    ```bash
    docker create hello-world
    ```

    Output:

    ```
    2b1bcbfcd3a1e6b1b899a4e9c1f4df06c9d4e5a7fbd3a35c2e8c5a6e90ab49af
    ```

    That long string is the **container ID**.

* **`docker start`**

  * Actually runs the container’s *startup command* (`CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` defined in the image).
  * If that process ends, the container exits.
  * Example:

    ```bash
    docker start 2b1bcbfcd3a1
    ```

---

### **3. Showing Output: `-a` (Attach Mode)**

By default, `docker start` runs the container **silently** — you won’t see the container’s logs or stdout.

To attach to it and see the output:

```bash
docker start -a <container_id>
```

Example:

```bash
docker start -a 2b1bcbfcd3a1
```

Output:

```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```

If you omit `-a`, you’ll just get the container ID again, with no visible output.

### **4. Key Difference Summary**

| Command         | Purpose                         | Shows Output?    | Creates New Container? |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| `docker create` | Prepares filesystem, assigns ID | No               | Yes                    |
| `docker start`  | Executes startup command        | No (unless `-a`) | No                     |
| `docker run`    | Creates + Starts container      | Yes (by default) | Yes                    |

---

### **5. Behind the Scenes**

* **Create phase:** Docker sets up the writable layer, mounts volumes (if any), and configures networking for the container.
* **Start phase:** The defined entrypoint command (like `/bin/sh`, `ping`, or `hello-world`) actually runs.
* Once the process ends, the container moves to the **Exited** state.
* You can still see it with:

  ```bash
  docker ps -a
  ```

---

### **6. Quick Demo Workflow**

```bash
docker create hello-world
# Output: <container_id>

docker start -a <container_id>
# Runs the command and displays output

docker ps -a
# Shows the container with STATUS: Exited
```

Would you like me to continue the next part — explaining the **Exited** state and what happens when a container stops (as hinted at in the next section)?
