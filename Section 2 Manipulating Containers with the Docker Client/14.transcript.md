This section introduces one of the most fundamental Docker commands:
`docker ps` — used to view running containers.

Here’s the **technical breakdown**:

---

### **1. Basic Usage**

```bash
docker ps
```

* Lists all **currently running** containers.
* Displays a table with columns like:

  * **CONTAINER ID** – Unique short ID (you can use this to manage the container later).
  * **IMAGE** – The image the container was created from.
  * **COMMAND** – The process or command currently being executed inside the container.
  * **CREATED** – How long ago the container was started.
  * **STATUS** – Whether it’s `Up` (running) or `Exited` (stopped).
  * **PORTS** – Any exposed or mapped network ports.
  * **NAMES** – Randomly generated name for easier reference.

---

### **2. Why You Might See an Empty Table**

If you’ve only been running short-lived containers (like `busybox echo hi there`), they start and stop instantly — so by the time you run `docker ps`, there’s nothing left running.

---

### **3. Keeping a Container Running**

To make `docker ps` show something useful, you need a long-running process.
Example:

```bash
docker run busybox ping google.com
```

* This container stays alive because the `ping` command runs continuously.
* While it’s running, open a second terminal and check:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

  You’ll see a live container entry similar to:

  ```
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND              CREATED          STATUS         PORTS   NAMES
  4a2f8b1b1f9d   busybox    "ping google.com"    10 seconds ago   Up 10 seconds          epic_corey
  ```

Press **Ctrl + C** in the first terminal to stop the ping process — this kills the container.

---

### **4. Showing All Containers (Including Exited Ones)**

By default, `docker ps` only shows *running* containers.
To see *all* containers, even those that have exited:

```bash
docker ps --all
```

or shorter:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Now you’ll see every container you’ve created, along with their exit status.

---

### **5. Why `docker ps` Matters**

You’ll use `docker ps` constantly to:

* Check what’s running.
* Get container IDs or names to use in other commands like:

  ```bash
  docker stop <container_id>
  docker logs <container_id>
  docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh
  ```
* Inspect container uptime and state during debugging.

---

### **6. Example Workflow**

```bash
docker run -d busybox ping google.com     # Run in background (-d)
docker ps                                 # Verify container is running
docker stop <container_id>                # Stop it
docker ps -a                              # Confirm it’s now exited
```

Would you like me to show how to **use container names or IDs with commands like `docker stop` and `docker rm`**, which are the next logical steps after `docker ps`?
